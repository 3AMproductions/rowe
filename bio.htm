	<!--<h2>Welcome home</h2>-->
	<p>Maren Roth has loved clothes for as long as she can remember.  At age 5, with the purchase of her first fur coat and trip to New York City, she was ready to set foot in the fashion world.  From playing dress up in her basement to participating in fashion shows, she has always gravitated towards up and coming fashion trends.</p>
	<p>Upon her first visit to New York, the fashion capitol of the world, Ms. Roth knew, from then on, that she would one day live there.  While studying consumer journalism with an emphasis on public relations and advertising at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, Ms. Roth also took fashion and art classes.  During the summer of her senior year of college, she moved to New York for an internship at the Men's fashion Trade Publication, D (Daily) N (News) R (Record), the men's bible of the fashion industry.  During her internship in the fashion department, she assisted the fashion director and fashion editors creating two to three photo shoots a week.  By the end of the summer she had helped style over 20 shoots and was asked to create and design her very own shoot as her final project.  Prior to returning to college for her senior year, she was offered a fashion assistant position at Men's Health magazine.  However, Ms. Roth turned down the offer in order to conclude her studies.</p>
	<p>After graduating from college in 2001 she immediately moved to New York City and landed her first fashion job at the mega-fashion Public Relations firm LaForce &amp; Stevens, where she worked on such accounts as Perry Ellis, Jill Stuart Jeans, Pepe Jeans, Genny For Byblos, Louis Fer&aacute;ud and Autumn Cashmere.  Ms. Roth continued her career in fashion by freelancing for high profile clothing companies such as Calvin Klein, Emanuel Ungaro and Leon&aacute;rd Paris.  She then worked for Christina Juarez &amp; Company working on such accounts as Technomarine, Chimento, Ellen Tracy and Amsal&eacute;.  From there she went to work for the prestigious wholesale showroom, Simon &amp; Ido, where she became the public relations director in charge of accounts such as Paul &amp; Joe, Lauren Moffatt, C&amp;C California, Foley &amp; Corinna, Mimi &amp; Coco, Cristi Conaway, Deb-el-Yu and Citizens of Humanity.  Throughout her four years in New York, Ms. Roth gained invaluable fashion experience and expertise, which included researching the newest and most sought after designers; producing fashion shows; creating look books; conducting fashion events; garnering maximum exposure press; and managing budgets and expenses.</p>
  <p>Ms. Roth has spent the last four years building her career in fashion and with the experience she has gained, she is now ready to take her talent to the next level.  Ms. Roth has always been complimented on her unique fashion sense and ability to pick out current trends.  By opening up Rowe, she will be able to bring her knowledge, love of fashion and business sense to the Columbus market.</p>
